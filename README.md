# flexer

Pretty much a copy of [Nuclear.css](https://github.com/callmecavs/nuclear.css) by [Michael Cavalea](https://github.com/callmecavs/) only reworked into only focusing on Flexbox. Massive props and cudos to him!

Purpose is to keep a quick **prototyping** flex library of sorts.

In it's current state it generates classes such as:
```html
<div class="d-if md:d-f">From inline-flex to flex</div>
```
